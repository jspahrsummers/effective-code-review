# Effective Code Review

Peer code review is an essential part of the software engineering process in any team or open source setting, but since most of us received little training in _how_ to do it, the quality of code reviews can vary wildly.

Based on my experience performing thousands of code reviews in large commercial and open source projects, I've developed strategies for making each review as effective as possible. In this talk, I'll present my process, along with the first principles that inspired it, to make your reviews much more valuable for everyoneâ€”the author, your teammates, and you (the reviewer) too!
